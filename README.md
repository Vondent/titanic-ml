# titanic-ml

A Data Science Project Written in Python that utilizes Classifiers to Predict the Survivability of a Person.  The purpose of this project is to determine whether we can accurately determine whether a person survived the Titanic for the Kaggle Titanic Competition.  

The notebook implements classifier models such as:
- Random Forest Classifier
- Decision Tree Classifier
- K Nearest Neighbours Classifier
- Support Vector Classifier
- Logistic Regression Classifier
- Guassian Naive Bayes Classifier
- XGB Classifier
- AdaBoost Classifier
- Extra Trees Classifier
- Gradient Boosting Classifier
- Voting Classifier

With the usage of these classifiers and binary predictive modelling,
